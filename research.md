For the Love of Lyman Alpha

Our story begins in 2018 at Penn State University (We Are), where I studied physics and astronomy as an undergrad. Fresh off my first _real_ astronomy course, I started working within the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) collabroation under Dr. Robin Ciardullo. HETDEX is an untargeted spectroscopic survey designed to detect and measure the positions of over 1 million Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs). These positions will be used to measure cosmological parameters at z~2-3. As a result, the HETDEX catalog contains millions of spectra from across the sky. 

While HETDEX spectra are faint and low resolution, there's power in numbers. Throughout undergrad, I used spectral stacking techniques to increase signal and measure the Lyman alpha escape fraction from z~2 emission line galaxies. My investment in HETDEX and newfound passion for LAEs led me to pursue a PhD at UT Austin under HETDEX PI Dr. Karl Gebhardt. 

Probing the Cosmic Glow with Lyman-Alpha Galaxies

The universe is filled with a faint glow known as the extragalactic background light (EBL) — the sum of all light ever emitted by galaxies, stars, and black holes. Measuring it precisely could reveal how galaxies formed and clustered, but separating this background from local foreground light is notoriously difficult.

In my work with the HETDEX survey, I study Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs), galaxies that shine strongly in ultraviolet light at the Lyman-alpha wavelength. When stacking thousands of LAE spectra, we find broad absorption troughs on either side of the emission line. These troughs aren’t instrumental artifacts — they appear to come from background light being absorbed by intervening hydrogen gas and the LAEs themselves.

This opens up a new way to measure the EBL (and its ultraviolet component, the UVB) at redshifts around z ~ 2–3, when galaxies were rapidly forming. Unlike traditional EBL measurements, which give an average over the sky, this method links background light intensity to local density variations. In over-dense regions, the absorption troughs deepen, hinting that the cosmic glow is stronger where galaxies cluster.

Next steps include refining radiative transfer models to reproduce the observed trough profiles and exploring how their width evolves with redshift. If successful, this technique could help resolve the tension between theoretical predictions of the EBL and direct observations — and provide a new window into large-scale structure in the early universe.
