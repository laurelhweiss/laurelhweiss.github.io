## Oh! You're still here! In that case...

Have you considered fostering with your local animal shelter? Animal shelters are almost always over capacity, and fosters are desperately needed!

Two great shelters in the Austin Area are [Austin Pets Alive!](https://www.austinpetsalive.org/) and [Austin Animal Center](https://www.austintexas.gov/austin-animal-center).

Fostering is an incredibly rewarding experience! Whether you are on the fence about adopting a pet or just want some short term company, fostering is easier than you think. Shelters provide the medical care and supplies, while all a foster parent needs to give is a temporary home and lots of love. Providing a safe space to heal and grow makes a massive difference in a pet's life and their potential to be adopted.

In case you need more convincing, here are some before and afters of the medical fosters I've hosted!
